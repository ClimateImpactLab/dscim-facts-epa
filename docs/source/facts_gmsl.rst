Running FACTS

.. note::
   If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to `setup WSL2 <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>` and run all of the following steps through Ubuntu. Once you have installed and setup WSL2, to launch Ubuntu go to your command prompt and type:
    
   .. code-block:: console

We recommend installing or cloning FACTS v1.1.2 found `here <https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts/releases/tag/v1.1.2>`_. We use the FACTS Docker to ensure replicability. First, `install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ and launch Docker desktop.
